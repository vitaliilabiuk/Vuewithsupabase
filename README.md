## ðŸ“‡ About The Project

As the name suggest, this project is a collection of projects that made with Supabase! It was heavily inspired by other "Made with xxx" website, and I wanted to curate all the submission for the first ever [Supabase Hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/2021/07/30/1-the-supabase-hackathon).

Also, I thought that this would be a great opportunity to use **Supabase Database and Storage** to showcase Supabase!

Therefore, [Made with Supabase](https://madewithsupabase.com) is also, made with Supabase âš¡!

It turns out that this project gained a lot of attention from Supabase users, as well as not-yet Supabase user ðŸ˜‚. It grew from 10+ projects to 100+ now! Supa awesome!!! ðŸ”¥ I believe it has potential to grow, thus I've decided to Open Source it, and welcome your contributions!
